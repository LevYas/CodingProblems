// 645. Set Mismatch
// You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n.
// Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the set,
//      which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.
// You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error.
// Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.
